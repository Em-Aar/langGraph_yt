        "In a typical chat-like interaction with Chat models (recent language models), the conversation has a flow, with alternating messages for the system, and from the user and the AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "In LangChain v0.3, the classes `AIMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `SystemMessage` and `ToolMessage` are part of the message-based interface used when interacting with ChatModels (like OpenAI's GPT). These classes help structure the communication between a human user, the AI model, and the system, enabling more complex and nuanced conversations. Here's an overview of each:\n",
        "1. **HumanMessage**\n",
        "- **Purpose:** Represents a message that comes from the human user. It helps the AI model understand that the input is coming directly from the user, which can guide the model's response to be more human-centric.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **AIMessage**\n",
        "- **Purpose:** Represents a message generated by the AI model (e.g., the response the model produces). This type of message denotes that the response comes from the AI and helps track the flow of conversation from the model's side.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **SystemMessage**\n",
        "- **Purpose:** A message that contains system-level instructions or context, often used to define the behavior or identity of the AI model (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). It sets the context for the conversation and can be used to control the tone, style, or behavior of the AI model by providing instructions or constraints that affect how the model responds.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **ToolMessage**\n",
        "- **Purpose:** This represents the result of a function call (Tool Call). In addition to role and content, this message has a name parameter which conveys the name of the function that was called to produce this result.\n",
        "\n",
        "content - content of the message\n",
